## **Overview**
_Created for the [Godot Platformer Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jTpR5D2z-xy7YRnWh9xnFM)_

A simple action-platformer game where the aim is to collect the required number of carrots and mushrooms, while avoiding death at the hands of the bees and worms patrolling the area.
With full joypad support as well as onscreen mobile controls, the game currently has about as much compatibility as I can give it.

## **Getting Started**
_A guide on how to get the project up and running._

**Prerequisites:**

Before you start, ensure you have Godot 4 up and running on your machine. Please take into account what the project was built with initially (see down below), in determining which version of Godot you'd like to use it with.

In order to clone the repository, you'll need either Git or GitHub Desktop.

If you want to build it for Android, the steps are a bit more complicated, so be sure that you have the Android SDK, OpenJDK installed, as well as Android Studio. You'll have to generate an APK using Android Studio and feed that into Godot in order to export the project.

Otherwise, the process is fairly simple.
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Project with Godot
3. Export or Edit and Export! (Note: export-presets has not yet been added to the project at this time, so if relying on that, ensure that you can set up the export settings yourself.)

**System Requirements:**

Since the project can run on Android, and was built using Mobile compatibility setting in Godot, the actual project itself shouldn't require much system-wise, and likely the only system requirements to take into account will be Godot's system requirements, which can be viewed [here](https://godotengine.org/download).

**Tools Used:**

- Godot 4.3
- Downloaded Assets from the Tutorial
- Miscellaneous Sound Assets (I'm terrible, but I forgot to write down the creators. All under open, royalty-free licenses though. Be careful though, as I'm not sure whether they were under commercial approved licenses.)

And with that, you should be good to go!

## **Gameplay**
_A simple one-level action-platformer featuring a bunny with a gun._

As of right now, the gameplay consists of just one level with various collectibles and enemies scattered around the map. Find your gun, defend yourself and collect the vegetables the Bunny wants.

Supported Inputs: Keyboard/Mouse, Joypad (Note: instructions default to Xbox button labels), as well as on-screen button controls for Mobile. 

For any future plans, please refer to [Future Plans](#future-plans) 

## **Future Plans**
_Currently, I have no plans to develop this any further._

As this was a simple tutorial project for me, I have no plans to develop this further as I'm moving on to create my own games from this point. Aside from any polish I desire to add to this one level, I have nothing further I wish to contribute to it. However, you are very welcome to do what you like with it!

As always, thank you for checking out my repository and have a wonderful day!
